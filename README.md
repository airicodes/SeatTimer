# SeatTimer | By airi ðŸŒ¸
A timer used to remind me to change sitting positions.
[Can also be used for anything else that might need a timer]

>**What you can edit**
(Everything is done via timer.js)
1. You can set the time in __seconds__.
2. You can put your own audio by simply replacing timerSound.mp3 with your own sound file.
3. You can change the image/text you wish to use as a pause/play button.
